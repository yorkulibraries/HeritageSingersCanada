## About the Heritage Singers

“The Heritage Singers Canada was founded by Grace Carter-Henry Lyons in 1977.
Meeting in living rooms, they gathered as friends to overcome the loneliness after
immigrating to Canada from Jamaica. The 30-member group is a dynamic blend of the
Caribbean, African and Canadian mosaic, drawing its members from Toronto, Trinidad
and Tobago, Pakistan, Guyana, the Congo, and Jamaica. Their inaugural performance
at the Harbourfront Centre in 1977 included songs from the sacred to the secular, work
songs, lullabies, and ballads. Over the years as they professionalized, they maintained
the friendships and connectedness that sustain nearly 50 years of volunteering their
time to preserve Caribbean heritage. The group is as much family as it is oriented
towards stage performance.

The group&#39;s mission is to “promote the development of Caribbean folk music and
theatre to the greater Canadian community, to donate part of the proceeds from
fundraising events to charitable organizations, to use folk-singing and dance as tools to
enhance ethnic, historic, and social traditions relevant to the Caribbean, African, and

other communities, and to bridge cultural gaps by helping other ethnic groups develop
an awareness of and respect for cultures other than their own.”

The significance of these fonds lies beyond the materials now preserved at the Clara
Thomas Archives and Special Collections at York University Libraries, where it sits
alongside the Jean Augustine fonds and the Caribana collection in the Kenneth Shah
fonds. Caribbean culture is grounded in oral tradition. It is within these embodied, living
archives—living “istriis” to use the Jamaican language— of songs, stories, movement,
and gatherings that our history is preserved.”
