description: "Welcome to the Heritage Singers Canada Collection site. 
<p> This online exhibit features a selection of some of the photographs, documents and videos highlighting the legacy of the Heritage Singers and their contribution to Caribbean folk music and performance arts. 
<p> The Heritage Singers Canada fonds include audiovisual materials such as cassette tapes of early performances spanning from the 1980s to 2000s, radio interviews, demos and rehearsals, and VHS tape recordings of performances. The audiovisual material preserves the language - both Jamaican English and Jamaican Patois/Patwa as interpreted in plays and songs by Jamaican Canadians, thus bearing the linguistic and other cultural changes and inflections that come with migration. Documentary records include brochures, programs, organizational papers, a portfolio, newspaper clippings from several Black newspapers in Toronto, and award certificates from various levels of government."
